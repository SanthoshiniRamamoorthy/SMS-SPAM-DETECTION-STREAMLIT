The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model for identifying spam messages in SMS text data. The approach involves leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques along with a supervised learning algorithm to categorize SMS messages into two categories: spam or non-spam (ham).
# DATASET
This project utilizes the "SMS Spam Collection" dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset encompasses 5,574 SMS messages, each labeled as either spam or ham. To access the dataset, you can download it from the following
